# React Gallery App

## About

This React Gallery App is a single-page application that showcases beautiful images fetched from an external API, the Flickr API. Users can navigate through different categories such as rivers, trees, and flowers, or use the search functionality to find images that match their interests. The app demonstrates effective state management, routing, and asynchronous API interactions.

## Features

- Dynamic navigation bar for category selection.
- Search functionality for finding specific images.
- Photo grid display with pagination controls.
- Responsive design for various device screens.

## Prerequisites

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure the system has the following software installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - The JavaScript runtime environment. It is required to run the application locally.
- npm - A package manager for JavaScript, included with Node.js installation. It is necessary for installing dependencies and running scripts.


## Running the App

To run the app in development mode, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the project's root directory where the `package.json` file is located.
3. Run the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the server and open the app in your default web browser. The application will reload if you make edits, and you will also see any lint errors in the console.
